Loosely speaking, the black hole region $\mathcal{B}$ of a Lorentzian 4-manifold $(\mathcal{M}, g)$ is the complement of the causal past of a certain distinguished ideal boundary at infinity, denoted $\mathcal{I}^+$ and known as _future null infinity_; in symbols

Thus, the black hole region $\mathcal{B}$ is the set of those spacetime events which cannot send signals to distant observers like us.
